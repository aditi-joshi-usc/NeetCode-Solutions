# Invert Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree `root`. Invert the binary tree and return its root.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```
**Output:**
```
[1,3,2,7,6,5,4]
```

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
root = [3,2,1]
```
**Output:**
```
[3,1,2]
```

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```
root = []
```
**Output:**
```
[]
```

## Constraints:
- `0 <=` Number of nodes in the tree `<= 100`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
