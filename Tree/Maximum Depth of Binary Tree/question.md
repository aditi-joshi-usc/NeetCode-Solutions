## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return its depth.

The depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
```plaintext
root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
3
```

### Example 2:
#### Input:
```plaintext
root = []
```
#### Output:
```plaintext
0
```

### Constraints:
- 0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

### Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree
