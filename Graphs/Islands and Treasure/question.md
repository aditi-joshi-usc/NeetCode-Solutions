# Islands and Treasure

## Problem Statement

You are given a `m Ã— n` 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

- `-1` - A water cell that cannot be traversed.
- `0` - A treasure chest.
- `INF` - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF`.

Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest, then the value should remain `INF`.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

### Examples

- **Example 1**:
  - **Input**:
    ```plaintext
    [
      [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
      [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
      [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
      [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```plaintext
    [
      [3,-1,0,1],
      [2,2,1,-1],
      [1,-1,2,-1],
      [0,-1,3,4]
    ]
    ```

- **Example 2**:
  - **Input**:
    ```plaintext
    [
      [0,-1],
      [2147483647,2147483647]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```plaintext
    [
      [0,-1],
      [1,2]
    ]
    ```

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is one of `{-1, 0, 2147483647}`.

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with **O(m * n)** time and **O(m * n)** space, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the given grid.
