# Combination Sum II

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `candidates` (which may contain duplicates) and a target integer `target`, find all unique combinations where chosen numbers sum to `target`. Each number from `candidates` may only be used once in each combination, and the result must not contain duplicate combinations.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: candidates = [9,2,2,4,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: [
  [1,2,5],
  [2,2,4],
  [2,6]
]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: candidates = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 7
Output: [
  [1,2,4],
  [2,5],
  [3,4]
]
```
